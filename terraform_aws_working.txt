Terraform + Aws

1) download and install terraform unzip it and copy the address and set it to environment variables

windows << edit environment variables << environment variables << path << double -click New << add the path << open cmd and type (terraform version) to validate

2) download and install aws cli << open cmd and type (aws --version) to validate

3) create aws free account

i) After root user is created add MFA
ii) Go to Users << create user << Select add user to group option << create group (search admin and select policy name with AdministratorAccess and 	
Description with Provides full access to AWS services and resources).
iii) Create user
iv) Logout from root user and login using the newly created user << Add MFA 

4) OPen Visual Code << create a directory where all your files will be kept (TF-AWS) 

5) Set the environment path
$env:Path = [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path","Machine")

6) run (aws iam list-users)
It would give some key credentials related error To fix this go to AWS Console << Users << select the available user(tf-user) go to Security credentials
 << Create Acces Key << Command Line Interface (CLI) << give any tag name << Create access key.
 
7) set the environment for access key
$Env:AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="AKIA5FUFRZJTOGBEDBLZ"
$Env:AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="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"

8) Run (aws iam list-users) it will generate below output
{
    "Users": [
        {
            "Path": "/",
            "UserName": "tf-user",
            "UserId": "AIDA5FUFRZJTLZMXVPB7O",
            "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::905444444774:user/tf-user",
            "CreateDate": "2025-06-19T13:59:58+00:00",
            "PasswordLastUsed": "2025-06-19T14:03:38+00:00"
        }
    ]
}


8) Let's create a EC2 instance first with console

Go to EC2 << Launch Instance << Name << AMI (which OS to be used in this case linux) << Instance type (t3.micro as this is free) << Key pair << Create key pair
<< Key pair name << Key pair type (RSA) << private key format (.pem) this would be download file a pem file << Network Settings << Create security group << Allow SSH traffic(Anywhere)
<< Select all other options as default << Launch instance..
